        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Although education can serve as the foundation for equality and
          provide communities with skills necessary to secure better employement
          opportunities, access to education is not equitable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision over the summer that colleges and universities
            can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis in admissions,
            we wanted to look at social justice in the context of education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Education justice is a critical concept in fostering equal
          opportunities and promoting a fair and inclusive society. It
          emphasizes the need to ensure that every individual, regardless of
          their background, socio-economic status, or other factors, has access
          to high-quality education and the resources necessary to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, we analyze education data to provide insights at the
          intersection of education and social justice.

        <h2>II. Data Collection and Sources</h2>
        <p>
          We used the

            >Opportunity Insights College Admissions Dataset</a
          >. The dataset includes admissions and attendance data from US
          colleges along with test data.

            <img src="data/app_rates_by_tier_and_par_income_bin.png" height="600"/>

            <label for="tier-select">Choose a Tier:</label>
            <select id="tier-select">

          <div id="acceptByParentalIncome" class="chart"></div>
          <script src="scripts/acceptByParentalIncome.js"></script>

          We can see that generally, admission rates increase with parental
          income. Using the select option to look at specific university tiers,
          we find that private schools, especially "Ivy Plus" schools, admit
          many more students from the Top 0.1%. This is significant, especially
          considering that the Top 0.1% make up a much smaller portion of the
          total population.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>XI. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So, what are the implications of education justice on design?</p>
        <p>
            In the context of human-computer interaction, awareness of education justice can emphasize inclusivity and accessibility in technology-driven learning environments.
            Designers mindful of education justice principles prioritize creating digital interfaces that accommodate diverse learners, including those from marginalized or underprivileged backgrounds.
            This awareness inspires the implementation of inclusive design practices, ensuring educational technologies are accessible to individuals with varying abilities, learning styles, and socio-economic circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considerations of education justice guide HCI designers in minimizing digital divides, providing equitable access to educational resources, and addressing potential biases in technology.
            These efforts result in user interfaces that promote equal learning opportunities, contributing to the democratization of education through technology.
            This dual focus on inclusivity and accessibility underscores the importance of aligning HCI design with the principles of education justice for a more equitable and effective learning experience.
