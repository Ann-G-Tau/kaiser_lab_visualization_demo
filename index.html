      <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          To address the issue of social justice and its determinants, 
          our group conducted comprehensive exploration in the topic.[1,2,3] 
          While contemplating various domains such as environmental protection [1], 
          resource conservation, and human rights[2], 
          we discerned a distinct connection to the subject of education justice[3], 
          fueled by our identity as college students. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Although education can serve as the foundation for equality and 
          provide communities with skills necessary to secure better employement opportunities, 
          access to education is not equitable. 
          Despite the inequality, education justice is a critical concept in 
          fostering equal opportunities and promoting a fair and inclusive society. 
          It emphasizes the need to ensure that every individual, regardless of their background, 
          socio-economic status, or other factors, has access to high-quality education 
          and the resources necessary to succeed.
          Different from other social injustices, education equality is critical 
          since it not only affects the present but also the future generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most pivotal catalyst for our focus on this matter was the recent Supreme Court's affirmative action 
          decision during the summer[4], delineating that institutions of higher education 
          can no longer consider race as a specific criterion in their admission processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given the multifaceted nature of Education Justice, we decided to develope an interactive interface.
          We hope the interface would have the following 3 advantages:</p>
        <p>
          1.	Enhanced Comprehension: We would like to use an interactive interface uses visualization to facilitate 
          understanding of the intricacies in Education Justice. We aim to simplify complex elements within educational systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          2.	Non-Researchers Friendly:
          We provide an alternative for individuals outside of academia 
          and research to gain information on educational research results. 
          We would like to engage with a broader audience, including policymakers, educators, and the general public. 
        </p>
        <p>
          3.	Raise Public Awareness:
          We aim to elevate public awareness on education justice through an interactive interface. 
          Through the power of the internet, we would like the interface to to catalyze informed discussions 
          and foster a collective understanding on the multifaceted challenges in our education systems.

        <p>The graph that the anticipated linear correlation in the data does not hold true. Instead, the graph displays peaks on the ends, indicating that colleges prioritize different values in their admissions criteria. This can be explained by the different situations for either extremes, individuals from wealthier backgrounds exhibit a higher enrollment percentage since they are able to afford to pay full tuition and those in lower brackets who may not be financially able often receive a favorable aid plan. However, individuals in the middle-income range receive minimal tuition assistance, although they lack the means to pay for their education in full.

          The right side of the graph appears more sparse, emphasizing the difference between public and private schools in these particular brackets. Public schools emerge as significant players, as they can offer more academic scholarships, influencing the decision-making process for prospective attendees of varing financial backgrounds.
          
          While the groups generally exhibit similar trends, specific examples, such as Harvard, stand out, highlighting the impact of individual school policies on admissions. This emphasizes the importance of considering unique institutional factors when interpreting broader trends in college admissions.</p>

        <p>This graph indicates a linear correlation with income, aligning with the expected trend. Schools demonstrate a cohesive flow, with the trend being more pronounced in higher-ranking institutions. However, there is a noticeable difference in absolute attendance rates across income levels within a college.

          The explanation for this difference can be explained by different financial situations. For example, an individuals from lower-income backgrounds is admitted, they may be less inclined to attend due to higher cost of tuition and may likely favor other more affordable options. This suggests that economic considerations play a significant role in shaping attendance choices, even when admissions policies accommodate lower-income individuals.</p>

        <p>The analysis reveals a linear relationship, particularly prominent in more selective and higher-ranked schools. Better schools show a stronger correlation with this trend. However, the cost associated with sending in applications might affect students in lower-income brackets, leading them to apply to fewer schools and potentially limiting their in the selection of where to apply and the risk they're willing to take when applying to selective schools.
          The ability to visit schools and tours may also influence application rates, resulting in higher values in the higher income brackets, likely due to travel expenses of such visits. Additionally, the support provided by college counselors in the application process appears to be more prevalent in better-funded schools.
          Moreover, colleges may allocate fewer admissions resources to lesser-funded schools. Consequently, students from these schools might have limited exposure to information about various colleges, potentially impacting their knowledge and understanding of the available options.</p>

          <p>The graph illustrates a trend with peaks at the ends, indicating higher acceptance rates than students applying. While the ideal scenario would be an even ratio of acceptance rates across all income brackets, it is crucial to ensure that the volume of applications from each bracket is also similar. Unfortunately, the current graph does not provide information on the volume of applications in each income bracket, making it challenging to assess the overall equity and fairness in the college admissions process. To comprehensively evaluate the situation, a more detailed analysis of application volumes across income brackets would be necessary.</p>

              The unweighted chart shows high attendance rates for students from the highest income brackets,
              especially the Top 1 and 0.1% and for Ivy Plus schools.
              The contrast between the highest parental income and other brackets is very pronounced,
              suggesting that students from wealthier families are attending universities at a much higher rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              What are some reasons for this? We can re-weight the attendance rates by test score and see how that changes attendance rates.
            </p>
            <p>
              For some tiers, like Ivy Plus, see a smoothing out of the distribution, though the higher income percentiles still achieve higher attendance rates.
              This means that while these universities might have made the acceptance rate more equitable between groups,
              there are still other factors besides test scores that contribute towards the differences we see.

          In the absolute attendance rate graph, peaks at the extremes imply that middle bracket students are less likely to attend, attributed to the high cost of school and insufficient financial aid. The relative attendance rate graph exhibits an anticipated linear relationship, indicating higher income brackets' increased likelihood to attend due to their ability to afford high tuition costs. The unweighted relative application graph displays a linear relationship, suggesting that higher-income bracket students may have more resources, enabling greater application numbers than lower-income students. The ratio graph reveals higher attendance rates than application numbers at both extremes, highlighting inequality between different income brackets.

          The key takeaway from this interactive interface is that college admission is influenced by multiple factors, 
          far beyond GPA and high school ranks. This finding is also coherent with the connection of various elements 
          contributing to education injustice. While the presented plots offer valuable insights, certain crucial information, 
          like extracurricular activities taken by students, is still unable to be captured through visualizations.

          Despite this, the significance of this interactive interface lies in the ability to enhance our Above 
          conclusions facilitate our understanding of education justice through single elements. 
          For each aspect examined in each plot, we hope to spread awareness and take small steps at a time to improve. 
          Measures to take include improving on how college application fee waiver works or provide more college 
          application guidance for low-income household would all be good things to start with.

          Looking forward, we would like to explore additional facets of education justice and adopting cutting-edge technologies, 
          including artificial intelligence and machine learning, to present data in more intuitive and accessible ways for continued progress.
