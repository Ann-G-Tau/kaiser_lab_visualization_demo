        <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Although education can serve as the foundation for equality and 
          provide communities with skills necessary to secure better employement opportunities, 
          access to education is not equitable. 
          Different from other social injustices, education equality is critical 
          since it not only affects the present but also the future generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the inequality, education justice is a critical concept in 
          fostering equal opportunities and promoting a fair and inclusive society. 
          It emphasizes the need to ensure that every individual, regardless of their background, 
          socio-economic status, or other factors, has access to high-quality education 
          and the resources necessary to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Following the Supreme Court's affirmative action decision over the summer that colleges and universities
            can no longer take race into consideration as a specific basis in admissions,
            we wanted to look at social justice in the context of education.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, we perform data analysis to provide insights 
          at the intersection of education and social justice. 
          This following interactive interface allows the user to 
          visualize more vividly what may contribute to education inequality.

        <h3>Relationship between GPA tier and parental income</h3>
        <h3 class="blue-text">Before diving into the interactive graph showcasing GPA distributions based on parental income levels, take some time for a guess between the relationship!</h3>
        <p> 
            In the forthcoming interactive graph, choose different income levels to observe the corresponding GPA distributions. 
            For a consolidated overview, click on the GPA summary plot.

        </p>
        <h3 class="blue-text">GPA tiers correlates directly with parental income. </h3>
        <p></p>
          Our findings indicate a discernible pattern: as parental income levels rise, so do GPA scores. 
          The interactive graph invites you to explore these nuances firsthand, allowing for a dynamic understanding of the data. 
          The overarching conclusion is that a higher parental income correlates with an increased likelihood of achieving higher GPAs. 
          Given the crucial role of GPA in college admissions, this correlation raises concerns about potential education injustices. 
        </p>
        <h3>Relationship between high school ranks and parental income</h3>
        <h3 class="blue-text">Before you dive into our next interactive graph, ponder a guess about the potential relationship between high school ranks and parental income! </h3>

        <h3 class="blue-text">High school ranks correlates directly with parental income. </h3>
        <p>
          Our findings illuminate a clear trend: an uptick in parental income aligns with higher high school ranks. 
          Navigate the interactive graph to grasp these subtleties firsthand, fostering a dynamic comprehension of the data. 
          The overarching conclusion is that heightened parental income correlates with an increased likelihood of achieving superior high school ranks. 
          Given the pivotal role of high school ranks in various educational pathways, this correlation sparks considerations about potential disparities in education.

            <p>
              The unweighted chart shows high attendance rates for students from the highest income brackets,
              especially the Top 1 and 0.1% and for Ivy Plus schools.
              The contrast between the highest parental income and other brackets is very pronounced,
              suggesting that students from wealthier families are attending universities at a much higher rate.
            </p>
            <p>
              What are some reasons for this? We can re-weight the attendance rates by test score and see how that changes attendance rates.
            </p>
            <p>
              For some tiers, like Ivy Plus, see a smoothing out of the distribution, though the higher income percentiles still achieve higher attendance rates.
              This means that while these universities might have made the acceptance rate more equitable between groups,
              there are still other factors besides test scores that contribute towards the differences we see.

        <h2>XI. Conclusion</h2>
        <p>So, what are the implications of education justice on design?</p>
        <p>
            In the context of human-computer interaction, awareness of education justice can emphasize inclusivity and accessibility in technology-driven learning environments.
            Designers mindful of education justice principles prioritize creating digital interfaces that accommodate diverse learners, including those from marginalized or underprivileged backgrounds.
            This awareness inspires the implementation of inclusive design practices, ensuring educational technologies are accessible to individuals with varying abilities, learning styles, and socio-economic circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considerations of education justice guide HCI designers in minimizing digital divides, providing equitable access to educational resources, and addressing potential biases in technology.
            These efforts result in user interfaces that promote equal learning opportunities, contributing to the democratization of education through technology.
            This dual focus on inclusivity and accessibility underscores the importance of aligning HCI design with the principles of education justice for a more equitable and effective learning experience.
